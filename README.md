# React app hosted on GitHub Pages

* This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
* The UI-specific code was written in [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/select-package-test-forked-liyr9k) and migrated manually
* GitHub Pages were deployed based on these [instructions](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages), with these exceptions:
   * package.json -> instead of  "homepage": "https://Jyri-droid.github.io/select-package", "homepage": "/select-package/#"
   * App.js -> <Router basename="/select-package">
