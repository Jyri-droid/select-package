# React app hosted on GitHub Pages

* This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
* The UI-specific code was written in [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/select-package-test-forked-liyr9k) and migrated manually
* GitHub Pages were deployed based on these [instructions](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages):
   * Exception: package.json -> instead of "https://Jyri-droid.github.io/select-package", "homepage" needs to be "/select-package/#"
   * Addition: <Router> component needed a base name. App.js -> "<Router basename="/select-package">"
